#recommendations.

1. Learning from the Best-Performing Regions

North America is doing really well in sales. We should take a closer look at what’s working for them — whether it’s their marketing, customer engagement, or product offerings — and see how we can apply those ideas to regions like Africa and South America to help them grow too.

2. Give More Support to Distributor Channels ie Distributor channel
 
   by offering more training, better tools, or even new incentives to motivate our distributors and make it easier for them to succeed.

3. Investing more in places where there is high sales volume
  
      to maintain or increase there sales volume by give more resources to the sales team.ie
in-store and direct sales are performing strongly.
